## Legacy Scripts
### salesChestGlobalHack
Just a quick hack of sales chest to add the global mode, before I actually added it in a less-hacky manner to the main script. Don't use this one. I don't even know why it's still here :P

### flatModifiersBasic
[Steam Discussion](https://steamcommunity.com/groups/mwmulti/discussions/0/1483233503861929448/) - Original version of flatModifiers, which wasn't dependant on classInfo.
