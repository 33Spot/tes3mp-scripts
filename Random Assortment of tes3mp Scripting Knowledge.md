Here's a random assortment of my acquired knowledge in regards to tes3mp scripting. It might not be very coherent or useful, but maybe somebody might learn from it.

## Version 0.6.1
### Gotcha - Getting The Character's Name
When logging in as a character, the login dialog doesn't care about capitalization (for example, my character's login is "N'wah", but I could enter "n'WaH" and the game will still accept it). At this point, the game sets *the name that was entered* as the player's name for the purpose of getting the name via `tes3mp.GetName(pid)` or `Players[pid].name` and *not* the character's login name (retrieved via `Players[pid].data.login.name`). If you're storing any data using the player's name, you should make sure to use the player's *login name*, since the *player's name* (capitalization-wise) can vary by login.

Alternatively you can circumvent most of this by using myMod's `myMod.GetPlayerByName(targetName)` :P

### Gotcha - Detecting An Object
If you're using Cell:ContainsObject(refIndex) to detect if an object exists in that cell, and that object is a data file object, then you also need to check that the object doesn't have a delete packet associated with it.
So for example:
```
if LoadedCells[cell]:ContainsObject(refIndex) and not tableHelper.containsValue(LoadedCells[cell].data.packets.delete, refIndex) then
	--Whatever
end
```
### Gotcha - Player Naked After LoadInventory()
You have to use LoadEquipment() after LoadInventory(), or the player will be naked.
```
Players[pid]:LoadInventory()
Players[pid]:LoadEquipment()
```

### Temporarily Loading Cells
(The following code is basically lifted from cell's base.lua)
```
local temporaryLoadedCells = {}
if LoadedCells[cell] == nil then
	myMod.LoadCell(cell)
	table.insert(temporaryLoadedCells, cell)
end

--Then later when finished
for arrayIndex, cell in pairs(temporaryLoadedCells) do
	myMod.UnloadCell(cell)
end
```
### Adding Items to Players' Inventories (Online/Offline)
The provided example is for adding/subtracting gold, though with a bit of adaption it could be used for any item
```
--Add gold to a player's inventory, regardless of whether or not they're online. Ideally, you'd use a different function to work out if they actually have the required amount of money in their inventory first if you're allowing them to purchase stuff
local function addGold(playerName, amount) --playerName is the name of the player to add the gold to (capitalization doesn't matter). Amount is the amount of gold to add (can be negative if you want to subtract gold).
	--Find the player
	local player = myMod.GetPlayerByName(playerName)
	
	--Check we found the player before proceeding
	if player then
		--Look through their inventory to find where their gold is, if they have any
		local goldLoc = inventoryHelper.getItemIndex(player.data.inventory, "gold_001", -1)
		
		--If they have gold in their inventory, edit that item's data. Otherwise make some new data.
		if goldLoc then
			player.data.inventory[goldLoc].count = player.data.inventory[goldLoc].count + amount
			
			--If the total is now 0 or lower, remove the entry from the player's inventory.
			if player.data.inventory[goldLoc].count < 1 then
				player.data.inventory[goldLoc] = nil
			end
		else
			--Only create a new entry for gold if the amount is actually above 0, otherwise we'll have negative money.
			if amount > 0 then
				table.insert(player.data.inventory, {refId = "gold_001", count = amount, charge = -1})
			end
		end
		
		--How we save the character is different depending on whether or not the player is online
		if player:IsLoggedIn() then
			--If the player is logged in, we have to update their inventory to reflect the changes
			player:Save()
			player:LoadInventory()
			player:LoadEquipment()
		else
			--If the player isn't logged in, we have to temporarily set the player's logged in variable to true, otherwise the Save function won't save the player's data
			player.loggedIn = true
			player:Save()
			player.loggedIn = false
		end
		
		return true
	else
		--Couldn't find any existing player with that name
		return false
	end
end
```
And as a bounus, here's how to find out how much gold the player has. Ideally if you're using a script to sell something to the player, you'd use this to first check if the player actually has enough money to afford the item before proceeding:
```
--Returns the amount of gold the player has in their inventory, regardless of whether or not they're online. Returns 0 if they have none, or false if the player couldn't be found, otherwise returns the amount of gold they have.
local function getPlayerGold(playerName) --playerName is the name of the player (capitalization doesn't matter)
	local player = myMod.GetPlayerByName(playerName)
	
	if player then
		local goldLoc = inventoryHelper.getItemIndex(player.data.inventory, "gold_001", -1)
		
		if goldLoc then
			return player.data.inventory[goldLoc].count
		else
			return 0
		end
	else
		--Couldn't find the player
		return false
	end
end
```
Hey lookie here! As a bonus bonus, here's an example of the original item adding script but adapted to work for any item, instead of just gold:
```
local function addItem(playerName, refId, amount, charge) --playerName is the name of the player to add the item to (capitalization doesn't matter). refId is the refId of the item. amount is the amount of item to add (can be negative if you want to subtract items). charge is optional, denoting the item's charge.
	--Set the charge to default, if not provided
	local charge = charge or -1
	
	--Find the player
	local player = myMod.GetPlayerByName(playerName)
	
	--Check we found the player before proceeding
	if player then
		--Look through their inventory to find where an existing instance of the item is, if they have any
		local itemLoc = inventoryHelper.getItemIndex(player.data.inventory, refId, charge)
		
		--If they have the item in their inventory (with a matching charge), edit that item's data. Otherwise make some new data.
		if itemLoc then
			player.data.inventory[itemLoc].count = player.data.inventory[itemLoc].count + amount
			
			--If the total is now 0 or lower, remove the entry from the player's inventory.
			if player.data.inventory[itemLoc].count < 1 then
				player.data.inventory[itemLoc] = nil
			end
		else
			--Only create a new entry for the item if the amount is actually above 0, otherwise we'll have negative items.
			if amount > 0 then
				table.insert(player.data.inventory, {refId = refId, count = amount, charge = charge})
			end
		end
		
		--How we save the character is different depending on whether or not the player is online
		if player:IsLoggedIn() then
			--If the player is logged in, we have to update their inventory to reflect the changes
			player:Save()
			player:LoadInventory()
			player:LoadEquipment()
		else
			--If the player isn't logged in, we have to temporarily set the player's logged in variable to true, otherwise the Save function won't save the player's data
			player.loggedIn = true
			player:Save()
			player.loggedIn = false
		end
		
		return true
	else
		--Couldn't find any existing player with that name
		return false
	end
end
```

### Detecting If Item Was Spawned/Placed
(Example lifted from cell's base.lua. Only the wasPlacedHere bit is actually relevant for this example.)
```
local wasPlacedHere = tableHelper.containsValue(LoadedCells[cell].data.packets.place, refIndex) or tableHelper.containsValue(LoadedCells[cell].data.packets.spawn, refIndex)

LoadedCells[cell]:DeleteObjectData(refIndex)

if wasPlacedHere == false then
	table.insert(self.data.packets.delete, refIndex)
	LoadedCells[cell]:InitializeObjectData(refIndex, refId)
end
```
### Deleting Objects
Blah
```
local splitIndex = refIndex:split("-")
	
for k, v in pairs(Players) do
	tes3mp.InitializeEvent(v.pid)
	tes3mp.SetEventCell(cell)
	tes3mp.SetObjectRefNumIndex(splitIndex[1])
	tes3mp.SetObjectMpNum(splitIndex[2])
	tes3mp.AddWorldObject()
	tes3mp.SendObjectDelete()
end
```
This will only remove the object from the server. There are additional steps to remove it, depending on if the object is a data file object, or a spawned object (see: Detecting If Item Was Spawned/Placed).

(Both these examples assume the cell is loaded) For spawned objects:
```
LoadedCells[cell]:DeleteObjectData(refIndex)
```
If the object is a data file object:
```
table.insert(LoadedCells[cell].data.packets.delete, refIndex)
```
After either of them, you should probably also then save the cell
```
LoadedCells[cell]:Save()
```
### David C - Example Of How To Properly Spawn A Rat
```
local mpNum = WorldInstance:GetCurrentMpNum() + 1
local cell = tes3mp.GetCell(pid)
local location = {
	posX = tes3mp.GetPosX(pid), posY = tes3mp.GetPosY(pid), posZ = tes3mp.GetPosZ(pid),
	rotX = tes3mp.GetRotX(pid), rotY = 0, rotZ = tes3mp.GetRotZ(pid)
}
local refId = "rat"
local refIndex =  0 .. "-" .. mpNum

WorldInstance:SetCurrentMpNum(mpNum)
tes3mp.SetCurrentMpNum(mpNum)

LoadedCells[cell]:InitializeObjectData(refIndex, refId)
LoadedCells[cell].data.objectData[refIndex].location = location
table.insert(LoadedCells[cell].data.packets.spawn, refIndex)
table.insert(LoadedCells[cell].data.packets.actorList, refIndex)
LoadedCells[cell]:Save()

for onlinePid, player in pairs(Players) do
	if player:IsLoggedIn() then
		tes3mp.InitializeEvent(onlinePid)
		tes3mp.SetEventCell(cell)
		tes3mp.SetObjectRefId(refId)
		tes3mp.SetObjectRefNumIndex(0)
		tes3mp.SetObjectMpNum(mpNum)
		tes3mp.SetObjectPosition(location.posX, location.posY, location.posZ)
		tes3mp.SetObjectRotation(location.rotX, location.rotY, location.rotZ)
		tes3mp.AddWorldObject()
		tes3mp.SendObjectSpawn()
	end
end
```
### David C, On Objects
There are two important tables in a Cell's data.
One is the packets table, where you just put in an object's refIndex to note that a particular object has a certain packet attached.
The other is the objectData table, where the actual information required to send packets is recorded...
For instance, if you're going to spawn an object, the objectData needs to contain the object's location.

The JSON cell data is completely disconnected from the server's memory.
i.e. If you do something like tes3mp.SetObjectPosition(), it has exactly no effect whatsoever on what is recorded in the cell data.
That's why you need to both:
1) Send a packet for the players who are on the server right now
and
2) Save the object in the cell's JSON data for future players
As for statsDynamic, that gets populated by an authority player sending stats packets about an actor that already exists.
i.e. You don't need to put that in when spawning a rat. The Lua scripts will fill it in after the rat is spawned and they get the first packet from a player about the rat's stats.

## Version 0.7\*
### Calling the functions of other scripts
Quick example of how to format your script/mod/plugin/whatever the hell they're called in 0.7 (henceforth referred to as a scriptamajig):
```
function GetValue()
	-- Whatever
end
```
Then somewhere after all the functions you want to give access to are declared (actually, not sure if it *has* to be after them if they're global...), ideally at the very bottom of the script: 
```
Data["MyAmazingMod"] = {}
Data.MyAmazingMod["GetValue"] = GetValue
```
Obviously change "MyAmazingMod" to your scriptamajig's name (technically you could change it to anything, but it's good practice to use your scriptamajig's name). Then in the other scriptamajig, you can call the function via:
```
Data.MyAmazingMod.GetValue()
```
